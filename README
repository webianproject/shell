== Webian Shell 0.1 ==

Webian Shell is a graphical shell for the web, a full screen web browser for devices that don't need a desktop.

It's an implementation of a design concept called "A Graphical Shell for the Web" [1] by Ben Francis. 

The code is designed to be run using Mozilla Chromeless [2] and currently lives on the Webian web site [3].

To run, check out Chromeless from github [4] and execute... 

  $ ./chromeless /path/to/shell/

...from the Chromeless source directory.

You can sign up to the Webian mailing list [5] or contact the author directly (Ben Francis) [6]
