# Webian Shell 0.3

[Webian Shell](http://webian.org/shell) is a graphical shell for the web.

## Getting Started

Webian Shell 0.3 is powered by the experimental Quantum Browser Runtime (qbrt) from Mozilla which you can use to run and debug the code.

To get started hacking on Webian Shell first make sure that you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [qbrt](https://github.com/mozilla/qbrt) installed.

The default home screen is [Webian Home](https://github.com/webianproject/home) which needs to be downloaded and run first if you want to use it.

Then simply clone the shell repository from GitHub and run it.

```
$ npm install -g qbrt
$ git clone https://github.com/webianproject/shell.git
$ cd shell
$ npm start
```

This will launch Webian Shell in a new window and also open developer tools.
