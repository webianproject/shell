# Webian Shell 0.3

[Webian Shell](http://webian.org/shell) is a graphical shell for the web.

## Getting Started

You can run and debug Webian Shell 0.3 using [qbrt](https://mykzilla.org/2017/03/15/introducing-qbrt), an experimental Gecko application runtime.

First make sure that you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

```
$ npm install -g qbrt
$ git clone https://github.com/webianproject/shell.git
$ cd shell
$ qbrt run ./
```

This will launch Webian Shell in a new window and also open developer tools.
