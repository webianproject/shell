[Webian Shell](http://webian.org/shell) is a graphical shell for the web.

## Getting Started

To get started hacking on Webian Shell first make sure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

Then  simply clone the Shell repository from GitHub and run it.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/webianproject/shell.git

```

This will launch Webian Shell in a new window and also open developer tools.

This desktop version of Webian Shell is powered by [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/).
